          You all right, Dexter? Like a sloth. I can do that. I'm a sociopath;
          there's not much he can do for me. You're a killer.

          Cops, I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I've lived in darkness a

          He taught me a code. To survive. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a
          piece. And Iâ€™m not even sure what the picture should be.
